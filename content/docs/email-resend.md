Resend is a third-party transactional email service. This site uses it for verification emails,
welcome messages, password reset links, and contact form messages.
Prerequisites: the domain is on DNS, and you verify it as a sending domain in Resend.

## Steps

1. **Verify the sending domain.** Add a domain you own in
   [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains), configure the DNS records exactly as the Records
   tab shows, and wait for the status to become Verified.

   - **Follow the Records tab as shown**: domains created after August 2026 configure the
     Return-Path with two `CNAME` records, while older domains use an `MX` + `TXT` pair on the
     `send` subdomain.
   - Those `CNAME` records **must not be proxied** (orange cloud), and no other record may share
     the same name, or verification never completes.
   - If Cloudflare appends your domain to an `MX` value, add a trailing dot:
     `feedback-smtp.<region>.amazonses.com.`

   Production verification emails must use a verified domain; Resend's testing domain has
   recipient restrictions.

2. **Create an API key.** In [Resend API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys), create a key with
   **sending permission** and save it — it is shown only once.

3. **Set the environment variables.** `RESEND_API_KEY` is a server-side secret and `MAIL_FROM` is
   the sending address:

   ```bash
   RESEND_API_KEY=<your-resend-api-key>
   MAIL_FROM=noreply@<your-domain.com>
   ```

   `MAIL_FROM` must be a **plain email address**; it is validated with `z.email()`, so
   `Brand <noreply@...>` is rejected. Neither variable uses a **`VITE_` prefix**.

4. **Deploy.** Hand the two values to the Worker in production:

   ```bash
   pnpm exec wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY
   pnpm exec wrangler secret put MAIL_FROM
   ```

   With automatic Release deployment, set Secret `RESEND_API_KEY` and Variable `MAIL_FROM` in
   GitHub **Settings → Environments → production** (a Secret of the same name also works; the
   Variable wins). Both are already in the deployment workflow's runtime upload allowlist.

## DMARC

After the domain verifies, add a DMARC record (record name `_dmarc`). Start at `p=none`
(report only) and tighten to `quarantine` and `reject` once every message passes:

```bash
v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:<your-support-email>
```

Point `rua` at an address that actually receives reports.

## Verify

```bash
pnpm run check:env
```

The `mail` item should stop reporting missing configuration. Then run the site locally, trigger a
sign-up or a contact form submission, and confirm the message shows up in Resend's "Sent" list —
a complete configuration only means the checks pass; domain verification and actual delivery are
still confirmed in Resend.

```bash
pnpm email:dev
```

Previews the four templates in `src/mail/templates/` (verification, password reset,
contact message, welcome) on port 3001, with live hot reload.

## Notes

- If the same domain also uses Cloudflare Email Routing for inbound mail, the record names differ
  and both can coexist — but the root domain may carry only **one** SPF record.
- Changing `MAIL_FROM` requires a redeploy (it is a runtime secret).

Once mail works, continue with the contact form in [Email Overview](./email), or
[Newsletter](./newsletter).
