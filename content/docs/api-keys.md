API keys let users issue their own calling credentials. Keys live in the `apikey` table and **plaintext never reaches the database** — the plugin hashes the full key with SHA-256 before storing it, and the list endpoint returns only a prefix, so an issued key can never be read back.

![API keys page](/docs/screenshots/api-keys.png "API keys: name, masked key prefix, creation and expiry; the plaintext key is shown only once")

## Steps

1. **Turn on the feature flag.**

   ```ts
   // src/config/website.ts
   features: { enableApiKeys: true },
   ```

2. **Open the keys page.** It lives at `/dashboard/api-keys` and its entry sits in the account center sidebar. With the flag off, the page 404s and the whole `/api/auth/api-key/*` endpoint group 404s too (`src/routes/api/auth/$.ts`).

3. **Create.** Enter a name and pick an expiry → `authClient.apiKey.create({ name, expiresIn })`. The `key` in the response is **plaintext** and appears only in that one response; the page shows it once in a dialog and then it is gone. A user who did not save it has to delete the key and create a new one.

4. **List.** `authClient.apiKey.list()` returns `{ apiKeys, total, limit, offset }`. Entries carry only the `start` prefix; the page filters by name on the client.

5. **Delete.** `authClient.apiKey.delete({ keyId })`, behind a confirmation dialog. The plugin also exposes `authClient.apiKey.update({ keyId, enabled: false })`, which disables a key without deleting the record.

## Server-side verification

`verifyApiKey` is a server-only endpoint and can only be called on the server. The key itself goes in the request body; which header you read it from is your own route's decision. This repo does not define one, so the example below uses `x-api-key`:

```ts
const key = request.headers.get('x-api-key')
if (!key) return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })

const result = await getAuth(env).api.verifyApiKey({ body: { key } })
if (!result.valid) return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })
```

`result` looks like `{ valid: boolean; key: {...} | null; error?: { message, code } }`. On failure `valid` is `false` and `key` is `null`, with the reason in `error.code`: `KEY_NOT_FOUND` / `KEY_EXPIRED` / `KEY_DISABLED`.

## Expiry

`expiresIn` is measured in **seconds** (the page picks days and converts), and `null` means no expiry. The plugin converts it to days and compares it against the server-side bounds; anything outside them is rejected:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `keyExpiration.minExpiresIn` | `1` | Smallest allowed day count; below it → `EXPIRES_IN_IS_TOO_SMALL` |
| `keyExpiration.maxExpiresIn` | `365` | Largest allowed day count; above it → `EXPIRES_IN_IS_TOO_LARGE` |
| `keyExpiration.disableCustomExpiresTime` | `false` | When `true`, client values are ignored |
| `keyExpiration.defaultExpiresIn` | `null` | Fallback when the client omits a value (in seconds); `null` means no expiry |

Expiry only matters **at creation time**: the plugin converts it into an `expiresAt` timestamp, and the list reads that one timestamp, so there is no way to extend a key in the UI afterwards — delete it and create a new one. When you change the bounds, change `apiKey({ keyExpiration })` in `src/auth/auth.ts` and `EXPIRY_OPTIONS` in `src/routes/{-$locale}/_layout/dashboard/api-keys.tsx` together, or users can pick a value the server is bound to reject.

## Notes

- **Turning off `features.enableApiKeys` only stops the HTTP endpoints.** A direct server-side `verifyApiKey` call is a function call and bypasses the route gate, so already-issued keys still verify. To stop verification as well, check `websiteConfig.features.enableApiKeys` in your own route.
- Plaintext appears only in the create response and is never returned again.
